Predicting survival, subtypes, and treatment response using METABRIC clinical and genomic data

# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction with METABRIC Dataset

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer survival, subtype classification, and treatment response using the METABRIC clinical and genomic dataset.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Predict **overall survival** of patients
- Classify **molecular subtypes** (e.g., Luminal A, Her2, Basal)
- Predict likelihood of **treatment response** (chemo, hormone, radiation)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Scikit-learn, SHAP, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Data preprocessing: scaling, encoding, imputation
- Feature selection: SelectKBest, RFE, SHAP
- Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 📂 Files
- `HAP_Final_Code_1203.ipynb` – Final notebook with all models and SHAP visualizations
- `HAP_Final_Report.pdf` – Full report with methodology, results, and interpretations

---

## 🌐 Dataset
- [Kaggle METABRIC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric)

---

## 📈 Key Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved ~92% accuracy for survival prediction
- Random Forest achieved ~97% accuracy for subtype classification
- SHAP visualizations helped interpret top features: tumor size, age, surgery type, AURKA, STAT5A
